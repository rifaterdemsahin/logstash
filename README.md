Formula
1. **Install Elasticsearch**:
   - Download and install Elasticsearch from the official website.
   - Start Elasticsearch by running the `elasticsearch` executable from the `bin` directory.

2. **Install Logstash**:
   - Download and install Logstash from the official website.
   - Create a configuration file (e.g., `logstash.conf`) to define your input, filter, and output plugins. For example:
     ```plaintext
     input {
       file {
         path => "/path/to/your/logfile.log"
         start_position => "beginning"
       }
     }
     filter {
       # Optional filters to process your logs
     }
     output {
       elasticsearch {
         hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
         index => "your-index-name"
       }
     }
     ```
   - Start Logstash with the configuration file:
     ```sh
     bin/logstash -f /path/to/logstash.conf
     ```

3. **Install Kibana**:
   - Download and install Kibana from the official website.
   - Start Kibana by running the `kibana` executable from the `bin` directory.
   - Access Kibana through your web browser at `http://localhost:5601`.

4. **Verify Data in Kibana**:
   - In Kibana, create an index pattern that matches the index name specified in your Logstash configuration.
   - Use the Discover tab to view and analyze your log data.

These steps should get you started with forwarding logs to Elasticsearch using Logstash.
