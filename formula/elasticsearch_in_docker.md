To install Elasticsearch using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker**:
   - Make sure Docker is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Docker website.

2. **Pull the Elasticsearch Docker Image**:
   - Open your terminal and run the following command to pull the latest Elasticsearch image:
     ```sh
     docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.16.1
     ```

3. **Create a Docker Network**:
   - Create a network for Elasticsearch to run in:
     ```sh
     docker network create elastic
     ```

4. **Run the Elasticsearch Container**:
   - Start an Elasticsearch container using the pulled image:
     ```sh
     docker run --name es01 --net elastic -p 9200:9200 -it -m 1GB docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.16.1
     ```
   - This command sets up a container named `es01`, connects it to the `elastic` network, maps port 9200, and allocates 1GB of memory[1](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html).

5. **Access Elasticsearch**:
   - Once the container is running, you can access Elasticsearch by navigating to `http://localhost:9200` in your web browser.

These steps will get Elasticsearch up and running in a Docker container. If you need to configure additional settings or run a multi-node cluster, you can refer to the [official Elasticsearch Docker documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html)[1](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html).
