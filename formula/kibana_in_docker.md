To set up Kibana using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Pull the Kibana Docker Image**:
   - Open your terminal and run the following command to pull the latest Kibana image:
     ```sh
     docker pull docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:8.16.1
     ```

2. **Run the Kibana Container**:
   - Start a Kibana container and connect it to the same network as your Elasticsearch container:
     ```sh
     docker run --name kib01 --net elastic -p 5601:5601 docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:8.16.1
     ```
   - This command names the container `kib01`, connects it to the `elastic` network, and maps port 5601[1](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/docker.html).

3. **Access Kibana**:
   - Once the container is running, you can access Kibana by navigating to `http://localhost:5601` in your web browser.

4. **Configure Kibana**:
   - When you first access Kibana, you will need to use the enrollment token generated by Elasticsearch to complete the setup. This token is displayed in the Elasticsearch container logs when it starts for the first time. If you need to regenerate the token, you can use the following command:
     ```sh
     docker exec -it es01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
     ```

These steps will get Kibana up and running in a Docker container, ready to visualize your Elasticsearch data. For more advanced configurations, you can refer to the [official Kibana Docker documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/docker.html)[1](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/docker.html).
