Here's a Mermaid chart that outlines the steps for setting up a log forwarder with Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Install Elasticsearch] --> B[Download and install Elasticsearch from the official website]
    B --> C[Start Elasticsearch by running the elasticsearch executable from the bin directory]
    C --> D[Install Logstash]
    D --> E[Download and install Logstash from the official website]
    E --> F[Create a configuration file logstash.conf]
    F --> G[Define input, filter, and output plugins]
    G --> H[Start Logstash with the configuration file]
    H --> I[Install Kibana]
    I --> J[Download and install Kibana from the official website]
    J --> K[Start Kibana by running the kibana executable from the bin directory]
    K --> L[Access Kibana through your web browser at http://localhost:5601]
    L --> M[Verify Data in Kibana]
    M --> N[Create an index pattern in Kibana]
    N --> O[Use the Discover tab to view and analyze your log data]
```

This chart provides a visual representation of the steps involved in setting up the ELK stack for log forwarding. If you need further details or have any questions, feel free to ask!
